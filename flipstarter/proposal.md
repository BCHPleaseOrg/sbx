# What is ZKP?

ZKP means Zero-Knowledge Proof.


# Why does SmartBCH need a privacy exchange?

Unlike Bitcoin's UTXO model, SmartBCH uses an Account model.


# Scope of Work

This is a continuation of previous work regarding CashShuffle and CashFusion.


# Purpose

To utilize the great work of Tornado.Cash, by creating a new UI/UX designed to manage Zero-Knowledge Notes.

The user-experience with platforms like Tornado.cash can be challenging for the "average" user.

Tornado.Cash v2 (aka Nova) has added new complexities, albeit with greater flexibilities in deposits and withdrawals.

The aim of thie project is the build an intuitive user-experience for ANYONE and EVERYONE.


# Mobile Wallet Integration(s)

It will be the goal to see that SmartBCH Exchange get added to the Bitcoin.com wallet.

> There is NO guarantee that this integration will happen. However, I've maintained a very good relationship with the Bitcoin.com wallet team, so I'm confident they'll work with me to see this done.

The exchange can be further embedded into ANY wallet that supports dApp and SmartBCH, eg.

1. MetaMask
2. Trust Wallet
3. ...


# Hardware Wallet Support

Security will be extended to hardware wallets, namely the Ledger Nano S/X.


# About Me

I actually [participated in Phase 1](https://github.com/weijiekoh/perpetualpowersoftau/tree/master/0023_shomari_response) of the [Perpetual Powers of Tao Ceremony](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377).

My attestation work was then handed off to none other than [Vitalik](https://github.com/weijiekoh/perpetualpowersoftau/blob/master/0024_vb_response) himself.

It is was this MPC (multi-party computation) that now provides the root for ALL modern (Phase 2) zero-knowledge ceremonies.

It would be a great privilege to bring SmartBCH into the company of the many great zero-knowledge blockchain communities.

Please don't hesitate to reach to me directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShomariPrince) or the "official" Reddit sub.
