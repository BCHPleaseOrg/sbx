# The Problem

The current treasury of SmartBCH is controlled by a centralized, "for-profit" entity that was assigned to the task as a "temporary" solution which permitted the initial launch of the sidechain.

# Our Solution

A NEW SBX Server run by a decentralized pool of "financially invested" individuals and teams that will effectively manage the treasury and all bridge activities. The pool will be determined (and weighted) utilizing the NEW XHedge Validators network currently responsible for 1/2 the security of the SmartBCH network.

> __Good to know:__ SBX is an emergency decentralized solution to solving a SmartBCH treasury risk imposed by the "temporary" custodian that was assigned responsibility at the launch of the sidechain.

# Campaign Goals

1. Build..

# Sponsors

We appreciate your support in bootstrapping this exchange and helping to receover the SmartBCH network.

### In the event of a successful campaign, the TOP 3 contributors will each be awarded a 3% share of the 21M $SBX token distribution.

__!! IMPORTANT !!__  
__You MUST include your SmartBCH address (or other contact) to qualify.__

> NOTE: The remaining tokens are currently unassigned.

$SBX will be used to vote on future governance decisions for the exchange.

# Introducing the SHA-Matrix

This scheme creates a decentralized "trust" network which offers an immediate alternative to the centralized bridge problem, until SHA-Gate is ready for production use.

The idea behind SHA-Gate is to package the entire treasury system into an elegant smart contract. After introspection was added to Bitcoin Script in the May 2022 Bitcoin Cash upgrade, this became a real possibility. However, it still remains a complicated scheme which involves the use of Enclaves run on the 3rd-party networks (eg. AWS, Azure) that support them.

The SHA-Matrix will be a far simpler solution, using more "conventional" methods and designed around the idea of a Circle of Trust. The trust will be established by a large group of individuals and/or teams that have interests MOST inline with the interests of the Smart Bitcoin (SBCH) network.

We propose to organize a team of capable individuals to oversea the initial development and design of the NEW Smart Bitcoin Exchange (SBX).

### This proposal aims to accomplish ALL of the following:

1. Organize a working group of developers to build a Smart Bitcoin Exchange (SBX).
2. Coordinate with active Validators to safely deploy the new SBX Server.
3. Coordinate with the current SBCH Treasury custodian to safely transfer the "escrowed" BCH into the SBX.
4. Work with current DEXs to integrate with the new network for BCH <=> SBCH asset exchanges.

> NOTE: SBX will charge a 0.1% base fee for each transaction to incentivize participation in the network.

# Campaign Budget

The __100 BCH__ _(approx. US$10K on 2022.7.1)_ raised during this campaign will be directly applied towards deploying a __Minimum Viable Product (MVP)__ for the new exchange and its supporting services.

All features and services will undergo a strict procedure from start to finish:

1. Design
2. Review
3. Build
4. Deploy

### SBX Server Development - 30 BCH

> Approx. 35 hours @ $85/hr

The NEW Smart Bitcoin Exchange (SBX) Server will be a multi-platform application for managing the respsiblities of the Validators overseeing the exchange.

### SHA-Matrix Contract Development - 40 BCH

> Approx. 50 hours @ $85/hr

A suite of smart contracts will be deployed to manage the SBX.

- ↳ SHA_Matrix_Exchange.cash (CashScript)
- ↳ SHA_Matrix_Exchange.sol (Solidity)
- ↳ SHA_Matrix_Treasury.sol (Solidity)
- ↳ SHA_Matrix_Gov.sol (Solidity)
- ↳ [SBX.sol](https://gitlab.com/bchplease/sbx/-/blob/master/contracts/SBX.sol) (Solidity)
- ↳ Bailout.sol (Solidity)

### API Deployment - 15 BCH

> Approx. 20 hours @ $85/hr

### https://api.sbx.cash

Our team will design, build and deploy an open Application Protocol Interface (API) to provide the MOST flexible integration options with the MOST popular software protocols:

- Java
- Android
- iOS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python
- and more...

> NOTE: The MVP's campaign budget will supply least 90-days of VPS services. We aim to secure a long-term funding solution in the future.

### Platform Integration(s) - 10 BCH

> Approx. 10 hours @ $85/hr

Our team will work directly with the individual participants of the exchange to integrate with their respective services. Software will be modified and/or extended to best meet the needs of the SmartBCH services.

### Documentation - 5 BCH

> Approx. 25 hours @ $20/hr

A dedicated site for documentation will be created to support all parties involved in the SBX.

# Production Budget

In an effort to quickly develop a "working" solution to not only the treasury situation, but a roadmap to a decentralized bridge, our team will implore a Rapid Development process of the next few weeks.

> PLEASE NOTE: This campaign is NOT to develop a full "production-ready" SmartBCH exchange.

Our aim to quickly design, build and deploy an MVP to (Testnet3 & Amber); and present to the community what should be a viable model for a "production-ready", fully audited exchange.

### Upon successful completion of the MVP, additional funding requirements may include some or all of the following:

1. Application code audits
2. Solidity security audits
3. Infrastructure upgrades
4. Bug bounty program
5. Additional research & development
