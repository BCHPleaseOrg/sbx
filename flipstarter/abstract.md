## Introducing Smart Bitcoin Exchange (SBX)

### ↳ https://sbx.cash

A __distributed Proof-of-Stake (dPOS)__ network of SmartBCH stakeholders tasked with effectively managing the __NEW Decentralized SmartBCH Asset Bridge__ using a suite of trustless, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) smart contracts.

## A "Smart" Bailout Plan

### ↳ https://docs.sbx.cash/bailout

This is an emergency proposal to mint a __NEW $SBX token__ to fully "socialize" the outstanding debt of the __~101,000 $BCH (valued at ~US$10,000,000)__ currently "locked" and made unavailable by the SmartBCH Treasury's "original" custodian.

#### $SBX (Bailout) holders will receive a share of ALL exchange fees _(0.1%)_, PAID OUT DAILY, until the (Bailout) contract expires.

## TL;DR —

This is a Flipstarter campaign with the purpose of expediting the work involved in producing a "functional" MVP to present to the SmartBCH _(~$10M)_ bagholders. We aim to incentivize them by minting a __NEW $SBX token__ and introducing an __NEW Cross-chain _(ie. $WETH, $WAVAX, $CAKE, CryptoPunks, etc)_ Asset Bridge__ that will generate the revenue _(0.1%)_ needed to pay back the _(Bailout)_ contract holders with a PROFIT!
