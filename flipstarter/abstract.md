## Introducing Smart Bitcoin Exchange (SBX)

### ↳ https://sbx.cash

A distributed Proof-of-Stake (dPOS) network of Smart Bitcoin stakeholders tasked with effectively managing the SmartBCH bridge using a suite of trustless, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) smart contracts.

## A "Smart" Bailout Plan

### ↳ https://docs.sbx.cash/bailout

This is an emergency proposal to mint a __NEW $SBX token__ to fully "socialize" the outstanding debt of the __~101K $BCH (valued at ~$10M)__ currently "locked" and made unavailable by the former SmartBCH treasury custodian.

#### $SBX (Bailout) holders will receive a share of ALL exchange fees, paid out daily, until the (Bailout) contract expires.

## TL;DR —

The purpose of this campaign is to expedite the process of getting a viable MVP built to present to the $SBCH (~$10M) bagholders whom we will incentivize by minting a __NEW $SBX token__; plus we aim introduce a __NEW cross-chain (ie. $AVAX, $BCH, $ETH, $MATIC, etc) asset bridge__ that will generate the revenue needed to pay back the (Bailout) contract holders.
