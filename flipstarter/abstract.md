# Introducing the 1st NON-CUSTODIAL, PRIVATE exchange for SmartBCH ü§´ üè¶ ü§ë üöÄ

In just 2 short months (on May 15th), Bitcoin Cash will receive a whole new bag of tricks; along with the promise of a fully decentralized SmartBCH.

But will we have adequate tools & resources to maintain the privacy options that we've come to know and love from Bitcoin Cash?

> __REMEMBER!__ Bitcoin Cash uses a UTXO model that's supported by the very popular [CashFusion](https://cashfusion.org) privacy protocol. However, SmartBCH uses an (Ethereum-like) Account model where a SINGLE ADDRESS is re-used 100% of the time by default.

## Ready to see what's coming? Check out the LIVE demos below:
