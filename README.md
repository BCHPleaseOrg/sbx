__Smart Bitcoin Exchange (SBX)__ is a distributed Proof-of-Stake (dPOS) network of SmartBCH stakeholders tasked with effectively managing the SmartBCH bridge using a suite of trustless, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) smart contracts.

> __!! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !!__  
This project is still under active development and __MUST__ be regarded as __ALPHA__ software. It will evolve rapidly over the coming weeks and months. However, until we achieve our first "beta" release, we are not committed to preserving backwards compatibility. Buttons may be moved or removed in future versions.  
__!! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!__

## The Problem

The current treasury of SmartBCH is controlled by a centralized, "for-profit" entity that was assigned to the task as a "temporary" solution which permitted the initial launch of the sidechain.

## Our Solution

A NEW SBX Server run by a decentralized pool of "financially invested" individuals and teams that will effectively manage the treasury and all bridge activities. The pool will be determined (and weighted) utilizing the NEW XHedge Validators network currently responsible for 1/2 the security of the SmartBCH network.

> __Did you know? —__ SBX is an emergency decentralized solution to solving a SmartBCH treasury risk imposed by the "temporary" custodian that was assigned responsibility at the launch of the sidechain.

## Smart Contracts

A suite of smart contracts will be deployed to manage the SBX:
