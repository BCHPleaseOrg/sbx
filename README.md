Smart Bitcoin Exchange (SBX) is a distributed Proof-of-Stake (dPOS) network of Smart Bitcoin stakeholders who efficiently manage a suite of trustless smart contracts using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

## The Problem

The current treasury of SmartBCH is controlled by a centralized, "for-profit" entity who was assigned to the task as a "temporary" solution that would allow the project to launch.

## The Solution

A decentralized pool of "trusted" and "vested" individuals/teams can utilize the new XHedge protocol to manage the job of securing the treasury of SmartBCH.
