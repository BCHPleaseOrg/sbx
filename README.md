Smart Bitcoin Exchange (SBX) is a distributed Proof-of-Stake (dPOS) network of Smart Bitcoin stakeholders tasked with effectively managing the SmartBCH bridge using a suite of trustless, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) smart contracts.

## The Problem

The current treasury of SmartBCH is controlled by a centralized, "for-profit" entity that was assigned to the task as a "temporary" solution which permitted the initial launch of the sidechain.

## Our Solution

A NEW SBX Server run by a decentralized pool of "financially invested" individuals and teams that will effectively manage the treasury and all bridge activities. The pool will be determined (and weighted) utilizing the NEW XHedge Validators network currently responsible for 1/2 the security of the SmartBCH network.

> __Good to know:__ SBX is an emergency decentralized solution to solving a SmartBCH treasury risk imposed by the "temporary" custodian that was assigned responsibility at the launch of the sidechain.
